To write a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) code to predict output when given input for testing, we can follow these steps:

Load the Input and Output folders containing pictures using a suitable library such as PIL or OpenCV.
Split the Input folder into training and testing datasets using a split ratio of 80:20.
Preprocess the images by resizing them to a suitable size and normalizing the pixel values between 0 and 1.
Define the generator model using a suitable deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The generator takes as input a noise vector and the condition (i.e., the Input image) and generates the corresponding Output image.
Define the discriminator model that takes as input the Input image and the generated Output image and predicts whether they are real or fake.
Compile the models and train them on the training dataset using an appropriate loss function such as binary cross-entropy loss.
During testing, load the Input image from the testing dataset and pass it through the generator to generate the corresponding Output image.
Save the generated Output image to the Output folder.
