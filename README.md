# Pix2Pix analysis of Temperature Disribution in Materials
The finite difference method (FDM) can be used to approximate the Laplace’s equation for steady-state heat transfer without a heat source. 
The Laplace’s equation is given by:
∇²T = 0
∂²T/∂x² + ∂²T/∂y² = 0
MATLAB was used to generate 6216 pairs of images as dataset using FDM method.
5000 was used for training and the rest 1216 was used for testing.
